# GPT-Based Language Practice

I've spent an incredible percent of my life on language learning. Recently,
living in Korea, a huge amount of my time is spent practicing Korean.

Even though I'm continually noticing my improvement, and am starting to
understand even complicated Korean text, I frustratingly still find myself
unable to have even the most basic of *real-life* Korean conversations.

This app is me experimenting with ways I can use GPT to most effectively tackle
that problem.
